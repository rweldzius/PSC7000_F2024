# Definition

--

- .red[Multi] + .blue[variate]

--

  - .red[Many] + .blue[variables]
  
--

  - Analysis of multiple variables
  
--

- When we analyze **multiple** variables, we are in the world of "conditional analysis"


---

# What is .blue[conditional]?

--

- Put simply: "conditional" means "depending on"

--

  - I.e., How does a variable of interest vary *depending on* some other variable?
  
--

  - "Variable of interest": the **outcome** (or **dependent** variable $Y$)
  
--

  - "Some other variable": the **predictor** (or **independent** variable $X$)
  
--

  - "Vary depending on": the **relationship**
  
--

- Mapping concepts into .red[data] .blue[science]

--

  - The .blue[relationship] between the .red[outcome] and the .red[predictor]
  
---

# What is .blue[conditional]?

--

- "Depending on" suggests a **causal** interpretation

--

  - High wages "depend on" education &rarr; education **causes** high wages 
  
--

---

# What is .blue[conditional]?

- "Depending on" suggests a **causal** interpretation

  - High wages "depend on" education &rarr; education **causes** high wages

  - In .blue[theory], this is reasonable: students acquire skills in school which are valued by the labor market.
  
--

  - But the positive correlation between education and wages might also be **"spurious"**
  
--

  - Higher education *AND* higher wages are outcomes of some **true cause** (i.e., upbringing, SES, etc.)

---

# (Re-)Introducing the Data

--

- Using the Michigan exit poll data

--

- Download pre-wrangled data from [GitHub](https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC7000_F2024/raw/main/Data/MI2020_ExitPoll_small.rds) and save to your `data` folder.

--

- `require(tidyverse)` and `readRDS()` the data to `mi_ep` object

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)

mi_ep <- read_rds('https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC7000_F2024/raw/main/Data/MI2020_ExitPoll_small.rds')
```

---

# Some Light .red[Data] .blue[Science]

--

- The "gender gap" in Trump support

--

- .blue[Theory]: Trump has expressed sexist views against women. Therefore, women should be less likely to support him.

--

  - **NOTE** the causal assumptions in this theory! 
  
--

- .red[Analysis]: compare support for Trump among men and women

--

- But first, some quick data wrangling

```{r}
MI_final_small <- mi_ep %>%
  filter(preschoice=="Donald Trump, the Republican" | preschoice=="Joe Biden, the Democrat") %>%
  mutate(BidenVoter=ifelse(preschoice=="Joe Biden, the Democrat",1,0),
         TrumpVoter=ifelse(BidenVoter==1,0,1),
         AGE10=ifelse(AGE10==99,NA,AGE10))
```

---

# Conditional Means

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  count(preschoice,SEX) %>%
  mutate(PctSupport = n/sum(n),
         PctSupport = round(PctSupport, digits=2))
```

--

- .red[Results] are **consistent** with the .blue[theory]

--

  - NB: .red[results] do not **prove** the .blue[theory]
  
---

# Conditional Means

- However, note that these proportions are out of *all* voters.

--

- This isn't directly addressing the .blue[theory]

--

  - We want to know the proportion **of women** who supported Trump
  
--

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  count(preschoice,SEX) %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>% #<<
  mutate(totGender = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(pctSupport = n / totGender)
```
  
---

# Additional .blue[Theorizing]

--

- The strength of the theorized relationship might vary by age

--

  - Younger women might be more offended by Trump's casual sexism
  
--

  - Older women might be more inured to Trump's casual sexism
  
--

- .blue[Theory]: the "gender gap" will be larger among younger voters

--

  - (But also recognize that younger Americans are generally more progressive...meaning that **both** younger men and women are more offended by Trump's casual sexism!)
  
---

# Two-Way Conditional Means

--

- We could just subset with `filter()`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  filter(AGE10==1) %>% #<<
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  count(preschoice) %>%
  mutate(PctSupport = n/sum(n),
         PctSupport = round(PctSupport, digits=2))
```

---

# Two-Way Conditional Means

- Or we could add `AGE10` to the `group_by`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(PctTrump = round(PctTrump, digits =2))
```

---

# Two-Way Conditional Means

- A little hard to make comparisons; so let's use `spread()`

--

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(SEX,PctTrump) %>% rename(Male = `1`,Female = `2`)
```


---

# Introducing `spread()` & `gather()`

- Data in `R` is either "long" or "wide"

--

- **Long**: One column for a categorical label and multiple rows
  
  - I.e., For each age group, we have one **row** for men and one **row** for women
  
--

- **Wide**: Multiple columns for each categorical label and a single row

  - I.e., For each age group, we have one **column** for men and one **column** for women
  
--

- In `R`, we can switch between **wide** and **long** with two functions:

--

  1. `spread()` (or `pivot_wider()`): converts from long to wide
  
  2. `gather()` (or `pivot_longer()`): converts from wide to long
  

---

# `spread()` and `gather()`

- `spread([key],[value])`

--

  - `key`: variable containing categories to make into columns labels
  
  - `value`: variable containing values put into these new columns

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/master/images/tidyr-spread-gather.gif" width=50%></center>

---

# `spread()` and `gather()`

- `gather([key],[value],[columns])`

  - `key`: name of **new column** that contains categories
  
  - `value`: values you want to put into this new column

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/master/images/tidyr-spread-gather.gif" width=50%></center>

---

# `pivot_wider()`

- `pivot_wider([names_from],[values_from])`

--

  - `names_from`: variable containing categories to make into column labels
  
  - `values_from`: variable containing values put into these new columns
  
--

<center><img src="https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/assets/img/posts/tidyr-longer-wider.gif" width=35%></center>

---

# OR `pivot_longer()`

- `pivot_longer([names_from],[values_from])`

  - `names_from`: variable containing categories to make into column labels
  
  - `values_from`: variable containing values put into these new columns

<center><img src="https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/assets/img/posts/tidyr-longer-wider.gif" width=35%></center>

---

# `spread()`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(key = SEX,value = PctTrump,fill = NA) %>% #<<
  rename(Male = `1`,Female = `2`)
```

---

# `gather()`

```{r}
MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  spread(key = SEX,value = PctTrump,fill = NA) %>%
  rename(Male = `1`,Female = `2`) %>%
  gather(SEX,PctTrump,-AGE10) #<<
```

---

# Save Summary for Later Use

```{r}
SexAge <- MI_final_small %>%
  group_by(SEX, AGE10) %>%
  summarize(PctTrump = mean(TrumpVoter),.groups = 'drop')

SexAge %>% filter(SEX == 2)
```


---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- Want to know **reason** for voting for candidate by **vote choice**

--

  - `Quality`: 4 category unordered
  
--

  - `preschoice`: 2 category unordered
  
--

- Some light data wrangling

```{r}
toplot <- mi_ep %>% 
    select(Quality,preschoice,SEX) %>%
    filter(grepl('Biden|Trump',preschoice)) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    filter(Quality != "[DON'T READ] Donâ€™t know/refused") 
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
(pReasonOverall <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quality)) + 
  labs(y = "Number of Voters", x = "", title = "Reasons for voting for a candidate",
       subtitle = "Michigan 2020 Exit Poll") +
  geom_bar(color="black",alpha = .4))
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- Can swap axes with `coord_flip()`

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pReasonOverall + coord_flip()
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- `fill` and `position = "dodge"` for **conditional** analysis
  
```{r}
pReasonChoice <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quality,fill = preschoice)) + 
  labs(y = "Number of Voters",x = "",
         title = "Reasons for voting for a candidate",
       subtitle = "Michigan 2020 Exit Poll",
       fill = 'Self-Reported Vote') +
    geom_bar(color="black",position = "dodge") + 
   coord_flip()
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pReasonChoice
```

---

# Conditional Categorical Analysis

--

- What about if we do this by `SEX`?

--

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=4.25}
toplot %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x= preschoice, fill = SEX)) +     
    labs(y = "Number of Respondents",x = "",
         title = "Vote by Respondent Sex",fill = "Sex") +
    geom_bar(position="dodge") + coord_flip()
```

---

# Be Attentive to `class()`

--

- How is `SEX` stored in the data?

```{r}
class(mi_ep$SEX)
```

--

- Need to convert it to a `character` or `factor`

```{r}
pVoteSex <- toplot %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x= preschoice, fill = factor(SEX))) +     
    labs(y = "Number of Respondents",x = "",
         title = "Vote by Respondent Sex",fill = "Sex") +
    geom_bar(position="dodge") + coord_flip()
```

---

# Be Attentive to `class()`

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=4.5}
pVoteSex
```

--

- Why is this a bad visualization? **Poorly labeled legend!**


---

# Part II: 2020 polling

--

- Let's introduce a different dataset!

--

  - Download and open [`Pres2020_PV.Rds`](https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC7000_F2024/raw/main/Data/Pres2020_PV.Rds)
  - Wrangle to get the popular vote margin, expressed in decimals
  
--

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
poll <- read_rds('https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC7000_F2024/raw/main/Data/Pres2020_PV.Rds')

poll <- poll %>%
  mutate(Trump = Trump/100,
         Biden = Biden/100,
         margin = Biden - Trump)
```

---

# The Research Question

```{r}
pRQ <- poll %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Biden*100),fill = 'blue',alpha = .5) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Trump*100),fill = 'red',alpha = .5) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 47,linetype = 'dashed',color= 'red') + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 51,linetype = 'dashed',color= 'blue')+ 
  annotate(geom = 'text',x = c(47),y = Inf,angle = 90,hjust = 1,vjust = 0,label = c("Trump's Actual Support"),color = 'darkred') + 
  annotate(geom = 'text',x = c(51),y = Inf,angle = 90,hjust = 1,vjust = 1,label = c("Biden's Actual Support"),color = 'darkblue') + 
  labs(title = 'Poll Bias in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election',
       subtitle = 'Predicted vs Actual Support for Trump (red) and Biden (blue)',
       x = 'Popular Vote Share (%)', y = 'Number of Polls') + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30,60,by = 5),labels = function(x) paste0(x,'%'))
```

---

# The Research Question

```{r}
pRQ 
```

---

# The Research Question

```{r}
poll %>% # Proportion that under-predict
  summarise(propBidenUP = mean(Biden < .51),
            propTrumpUP = mean(Trump < .47))
```
--

```{r}
poll %>% # Average under-prediction
  summarise(avgBidenErr = mean(.51 - Biden),
            avgTrumpErr = mean(.47 - Trump))
```


---

# .blue[Theorizing]

--

- .blue[Research Question]: Why do polls under-predict Trump more than Biden?

--

  1. Unrepresentative samples (how were respondents contacted?)
  
  2. Small samples (how many respondents?)
  
  3. Shy Trump Voters / trolls (lying respondents)
  
  4. Timing (closer to the election &rarr; less biased)

---

# .blue[Theorizing]

- A fifth explanation?

--

- Anti-Trump media!

# .blue[Theorizing]

- However...

---

# .blue[Theorizing]

--

- Theory #1: Does the "mode" of the survey matter?

--

  - I.e., if you only call people on landlines, who do you reach?
  
--

  - And how might they differ from the general population?
  
--

- .blue[Assumption 1]: Younger people do not use landlines, meaning that surveys which rely on **r**andom **d**igit **d**ialing (RDD) will get disproportionately older respondents.

--

- .blue[Assumption 2]: Younger voters are more progressive, making them less likely to support Trump.

--

- .blue[Theory]: Surveys that use RDD will find more support for Trump than Biden.

---

# .red[Analyzing]

--

- Plot the Biden-Trump vote margin by mode type

```{r}
poll %>%
  count(Mode)
```

--

- So many modes of interviewing people!

---

# (Soft) Rules of Visualization

- Variable `type` informs visualization

--

1. Univariate

  - Categorical data: `geom_bar()`
  
  - Continuous data: `geom_histogram()` or `geom_density()`
  
--

2. Bivariate

  - Categorical X Categorical: `geom_bar()`
  
  - Binary X Continuous: `geom_histogram()` or `geom_density()`
  
  - Categorical X Continuous: `geom_boxplot()` or `geom_violin()`
  
  - Continuous X Continuous: `geom_point()`
  
---

# Beyond Bivariate

2. Trivariate

  - Categorical X Categorical X Continuous: `geom_tile()`
  
  - Continuous X Continuous X Categorical: `geom_point()` + `color`
  
  - Continuous X Continuous X Continuous: `geom_point()` + `color`/`size`
  
  - Latitude X Longitude X Categorical / Continuous: Maps!
  
  - Var X Var X Time: Animated!
  
  - (Beyond the scope of this course, but get creative!)

---

# .red[Analyzing]

- For now, just focus on `IRV/Online` versus `Live phone - RDD`

--

- Since `margin` is a continuous variable, use `geom_histogram`

```{r}
pMode <- poll %>% 
  filter(Mode == "IVR/Online" | Mode == "Live phone - RDD") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x= margin, fill = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
         x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
        fill = "Mode of Interview") +
    geom_histogram(bins=10, color="black", position="dodge") + #<<
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# Mode Matters!

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pMode
```

--

- But results are **inconsistent** with our .blue[theory]!

---

# Visualization

--

- How can we improve this? Perhaps `geom_density()` and `geom_vline()`?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
toplot <- poll %>% 
  filter(Mode == "IVR/Online" | Mode == "Live phone - RDD")

pModeDens <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= margin, color = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
       x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
       title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
       color = "Mode of Interview") +
  geom_density(lwd = 1.2) + #<<
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + 
  geom_vline(data = toplot %>%
               group_by(Mode) %>%
               summarise(margin = mean(margin)),aes(xintercept = margin,color = Mode),linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# Visualization

- How can we improve this? Perhaps `geom_density()` and `geom_vline()`?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeDens
```

---

# More Modes

--

- `geom_histogram()` and `geom_density()` less useful for more comparisons

--

- First, let's drop modes that were hardly used

```{r}
(toKeep <- poll %>%
  count(Mode) %>%
  filter(n > 5, #<<
         !is.na(Mode)))

toplot <- poll %>% filter(Mode %in% toKeep$Mode)
```

---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_histogram()` with more categories?

```{r}
pModeHist <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= margin, fill = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
       x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
       title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
       fill = "Mode of Interview") +
  geom_histogram(color = 'black',position = 'dodge',bins = 10) + #<<
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_histogram()` with more categories?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeHist
```



---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_density()` with more categories?

```{r}
pModeDens <- toplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= margin, color = Mode)) +     
  labs(y = "Number of Polls",
       x = "Biden- Trump Margin",
       title = "Biden-Trump Margin for Two Types of Polls",
       color = "Mode of Interview") +
  geom_density(lwd = 1.2) + #<<

                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + 
  geom_vline(data = toplot %>%
               group_by(Mode) %>%
               summarise(margin = mean(margin)),aes(xintercept = margin,color = Mode),linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# More Modes

- How hard is `geom_density()` with more categories?

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeDens
```

---

# `geom_boxplot()`

--

- More categories requires more compact ways of visualizing distributions

--

```{r}
pModeBox <- toplot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Mode, y = margin)) + 
    labs(x = "Mode of Survey Interview",
         y = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "2020 Popular Vote Margin by Type of Poll") +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "slateblue") + #<<
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# `geom_boxplot()`

- More categories requires more compact ways of visualizing distributions

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeBox
```

---

# Ordering Unordered Categories

--

- We can use `reorder()` to arrange categories by the data

```{r}
pModeBox <- toplot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Mode,margin), y = margin)) + #<<
    labs(x = "Mode of Survey Interview",
         y = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "2020 Popular Vote Margin by Type of Poll") +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "slateblue") + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

---

# Ordering Unordered Categories

- We can use `reorder()` to arrange categories by the data

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeBox + coord_flip()
```

---

# `geom_violin()`

--

- Boxplots are cleaner than densities and histograms for multiple categories

--

- But we lose ability to see distributions within the 80% box

```{r}
pModeViol <- toplot %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Mode,margin), y = margin)) + 
    labs(x = "Mode of Survey Interview",
         y = "Biden- Trump Margin",
         title = "2020 Popular Vote Margin by Type of Poll") +
    geom_violin(fill = "slateblue",alpha = .5) + #<<
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-.1,.2,by=.05),
                     labels= scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```


---

# `geom_violin()`

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.width=9,fig.height=5}
pModeViol + geom_hline(yintercept = 0,linetype = 'dashed')
```

---

# Continuous by Continuous

--

- For .blue[conditional relationships] between two .red[continuous variables], use `geom_point()`

--

- .blue[Theory]: Are polls politically biased?

--

  - I.e., a Biden-friendly poll might **under**predict Trump support and **over**predict Biden support
  
--

- .red[Data]: Trump support conditional on Biden support



---

# .red[Analysis]

- Plot Trump support versus Biden support

```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump)) + 
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",

# `geom_scatter()`

```{r}

```

--

- How many observations are at each point?

---

# Tweaking `alpha`

--

- We can set the transparency of each point such that multiple points will show up darker

--

  - I.e., `alpha=.3` means that a single point will be 70% transparent, but 3 points on top of each other will be 10% transparent

```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump)) + 
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",
       x = "Biden Support") +

```

---

# Tweaking `alpha`

```{r}
pSupp
```

---

# `geom_jitter()`

--

- Instead, we could "jitter" the points

--

  - This adds some random noise to each point to shake them off each other
  
```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump)) + 
  labs(title="Biden and Trump Support in 2020 National Popular Vote",
       y = "Trump Support",

```

---

# `geom_jitter()`

```{r}
pSupp
```


---

# `size`

--

- Finally, we could simply count the number of polls at each x,y coordinate

--

  - Then size the points by the number of polls
  
```{r}
pSupp <- poll %>%
  group_by(Biden,Trump) %>%
  summarise(nPolls = n()) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = Biden, y = Trump,size = nPolls)) + #<<

# .blue[Theory]

--

- These results indicate that polls which predict greater support for Biden **also** predict greater support for Trump

--

  - Is this consistent with the theory?
  
--

  - Recall that **Biden-biased** polls should underpredict Trump support and overpredict Biden support
  
--

  - In the .red[data], this would suggest a **negative** relationship
  
--

  - But we find a **positive** relationship
  
--

- **Inconsistent** with the theory, but raises another puzzle

# Dates and More Dimensions

--

- To test the .blue[timing of polls theory], let's look at how predicted support varies over time

--

```{r}
poll %>%
  select(StartDate,EndDate,DaysinField)
```

---

# Dates

--

- Need to convert `StartDate` and `EndDate` into `date` class

```{r}
election.day <- as.Date("11/3/2020", "%m/%d/%Y")  
election.day

election.day16 <- as.Date("11/8/2016", "%m/%d/%Y")
election.day16

election.day - election.day16
```

# Wrangling

```{r}

# 3. The Electoral College

--

- U.S. presidents determined by the **Electoral College** (EC)

--

  - Each state allocated votes equal to their "congressional delegation"
  
--

  - One vote per Senator + one vote per **M**ember **o**f **t**he **H**ouse (MotH)

--

  - 100 Senators + 435 MotHs + 3 votes for DC = 538 total votes
  
--

  - To win the presidency, you need at least 270 EC votes
  
--

- What does this mean for representation?

--

  - Population divided equally\* across 435 MotHs
  
--

  - In 2020, each MotH represented 761,179 people

--

  - Geographic distribution of this population is **non-uniform**
  
---

# Assigning Districts

--

- Every 10 years, U.S. takes a census of its population

--

- Based on these results, congressional districts are reapportioned

--

- In 2010, Florida's pop. was ~19m & average pop. per MotH was ~710k

--

  - How many MotHs? `ceiling(19000000 / 710000)` = ``r ceiling(19000000 / 710000)``
  
--

  - Every state has 2 senators, so FL had 27 + 2 = 29 EC votes
  
--

  - In 2020, FL pop. was 21m &rarr; each resident had 0.00000137 of a vote

--

- What about Vermont?

--

  - 3 EC votes / 624,340 residents = 0.00000481
  
--

- Vermonters have roughly 3.5 times the influence of Floridians!

# Introducing Data

--

- We will attempt to use state polls to predict 2020 winner

--

- National polls are great at predicting popular vote share...

--

- ...but presidents aren't elected based on popular vote

--

- With a few exceptions, states have a "winner take all" system

--

  - Winner of state's popular vote gets **all** of the state's EC votes
  
--

- Thus we need good state-level polls

--

- Load [`Pres2020_StatePolls.Rds`](https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC7000_F2024/raw/main/Data/Pres2020_StatePolls.Rds) to `statePoll` object

```{r,message = F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
statePoll <- read_rds('https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC7000_F2024/raw/main/Data/Pres2020_StatePolls.Rds')
```

---

# Look at the data

```{r}
glimpse(statePoll)
```


---

# .blue[Scientific] Goal: Predict Winner

--

- Need to calculate predicted probability of Biden victory

--

  1. Fraction of polls with Biden in the lead
  
  2. Fraction of respondents supporting Biden
  
  3. Fraction of twoway respondents supporting Biden
  
--

- Wrangling time!

```{r}

  mutate(Biden2W = Biden / (Biden+Trump),
         Biden = Biden / 100,
         Trump = Trump/100)

# Translate to EC Votes

--

- Start with a single state to get the idea

--

- **Expected Value** (EV...could also be Expected Votes): Probability * Value

```{r}
stateProbs %>%
  filter(State == 'PA') %>%
  mutate(BEV1 = BidenProb1 * EV,
         BEV2 = BidenProb2 * EV,
         BEV3 = BidenProb3 * EV) %>%
  select(EV,matches('^B.*\\d'))
```

--

- Probability matters! Biden could get between 18.3 and 9.98 votes in PA!

---

# Translate to EC Votes

- Do this for every state

```{r}
stateProbs %>%
  mutate(BidenEV1 = BidenProb1 * EV,
         BidenEV2 = BidenProb2 * EV,
         BidenEV3 = BidenProb3 * EV,
         TrumpEV1 = EV - BidenEV1,
         TrumpEV2 = EV - BidenEV2,
         TrumpEV3 = EV - BidenEV3) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(matches('EV\\d')),sum) # Fancy shortcut!
```

--

- Overall EC votes *always* favored Biden (always above 270)

--

- But none of our estimates are close to the true outcome of 306 to 232

---

# .blue[Science] Questions

--

- We know that **national** polls changed closer to election

--

- Can we do better if we look only at **state** polls close to election day?

         TrumpEV3 = EV - BidenEV3) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(matches('EV\\d')),sum)
```


---

# Conclusion

--

- Still not nailing the true votes!

--

  - Not even within the distributions of the bootstrapped estimates!
  
--

- Why?

--

  1. Polls have their own uncertainty (could weight by total respondents?)
  
  2. Polls might not be representative of voters
  
  3. Polls might not be independent of each other
