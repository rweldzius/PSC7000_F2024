# Recap of Movie Analysis

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)

mv <- read_rds('https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC4175_F2024/raw/main/Data/mv.Rds')
```

--

- .blue[Theory]: the more a movie costs, the more it should make

--

  - If not, Hollywood would go out of business!
  
--

- $X$: budget

- $Y$: gross

---

# Step 1: Look

```{r}
summary(mv %>% select(gross,budget))
```

---

# Step 1: Look

```{r}
mv %>%
  mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(gross) | is.na(budget),1,0)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(propMissing = mean(missing)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,y = propMissing)) + geom_line() #<<
```


---

# Some quick wrangling

```{r}
mv <- mv %>%
  drop_na(gross,budget)

mv %>%
  select(gross,budget) %>%
  glimpse()
```

---

# Step 2: Univariate Viz

```{r}
mv %>%
  select(title,gross,budget) %>%
  gather(metric,value,-title) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value,color = metric)) + 
  geom_density()
```

---

# More Wrangling?

--

- Univariate visualization higlights significant **skew** in both measures

  - Most movies don't cost a lot and don't make a lot

  - But there are a few blockbusters that pull the density way out

- Let's **wrangle** two new variables that take the log of these skewed measures

  - Logging transforms skewed measures to more "normal" measures

```{r}
mv <- mv %>%
  mutate(gross_log = log(gross),
         budget_log = log(budget))
```

---

# Step 2: Univariate Viz

```{r}
mv %>%
  select(title,gross_log,budget_log) %>%
  gather(metric,value,-title) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value,color = metric)) + 
  geom_density()
```

---

# Step 3: Multivariate Viz

```{r}
pClean <- mv %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = budget,y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  labs(title = "Movie Costs and Returns",
       x = "Costs (logged budget)",
       y = "Returns (logged gross)")
```

---

# Step 3: Multivariate Viz

```{r}
pClean + geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

---

# Step 4: Regression!

```{r}
m <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log,data = mv)
summary(m)
```


---

# Step 5.1: Univariate Viz of Errors

- Errors $\varepsilon = Y - \hat{Y}$

  - In `R`, can also get them via `resid()` function

```{r}
mv <- mv %>%
  mutate(errors_manual = gross_log - predict(m),
         errors_resid = resid(m))

```

---

# Step 5.1: Univariate Viz of Errors

```{r,message=F}
mv %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = errors_resid)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

---

# Step 5.2: Multivariate Viz of Errors

```{r,message=F}
mv %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = budget_log,y = errors_resid)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

---

# Step 5.3: Cross Validated RMSE

```{r}
set.seed(123)
rmseBudget <- NULL
for(i in 1:100) {
  inds <- sample(1:nrow(mv),size = round(nrow(mv)/2),replace = F)
  
  train <- mv %>% slice(inds)
  test <- mv %>% slice(-inds)
  
  mTrain <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log,train)
  
  test$preds <- predict(mTrain,newdata = test)
  
  rmse <- sqrt(mean((test$gross_log - test$preds)^2,na.rm=T))
  rmseBudget <- c(rmseBudget,rmse)
}

mean(rmseBudget)
```

---


# Thinking like a .blue[scientist]

--

- Our previous model predicted `gross` as a function of `budget`

--

- .blue[Theoretically], is this sensible?

--
    
  1. Bigger budgets &rarr; famous actors &rarr; mass appeal &rarr; more tickets
  
--

  2. Bigger budgets &rarr; advertising money &rarr; mass appeal &rarr; more tickets
  
--

- But what if the movie is just...not good?


---

# Alternative .blue[Theory]

--

- Good movies make more money

--

  - .blue[Theory]: good movies &rarr; recommendations &rarr; more tickets
  
--

- Predict gross with .red[IMDB rating] (`score`)

```{r}
pIMDB <- mv %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = score,y = gross)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Movie gross as a function of public perception",
       x = "IMDB score",
       y = "Gross (logged)") + 
  scale_y_log10(label = scales::dollar) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se = F)
```

---

# Alternative .red[Model]

```{r,message = F}
pIMDB
```

---

# Evaluating the Model

- Let's go straight to RMSE

  - We can have `R` calculate errors for us with `residuals()` command

```{r}
m2 <- lm(gross_log ~ score,mv)
error <- residuals(m2)
(rmseScore <- sqrt(mean(error^2)))
```

- Even worse!

---

# Multivariate Regression

--

- Recall that we can **model** our outcome with multiple **predictors**

$$Y = \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \varepsilon$$

--

- How much better can we predict `gross` with **BOTH** `budget` and `score`?

```{r}
m3 <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log + score,mv)
error <- residuals(m3)
(rmseBudgScore <- sqrt(mean(error^2)))
```

---

# Comparing Models

--

- Which model best predicts movie revenues?

```{r}
p <- data.frame(budget = mean(rmseBudget),
           IMDB = rmseScore,
           combined = rmseBudgScore) %>%
  gather(model,rmse) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(model,rmse),y = rmse)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(title = "Best Regression Model",
       subtitle = "Predicting a movie's revenue",
       y = "RMSE (lower is better)",
       x = "Model") + 
  coord_flip()
```

---

# Comparing Models

- Which model best predicts movie revenues?

```{r}
p
```


---

# Why RMSE?

--

- Want to understand how good / bad our model is

--

- Can use it to compare models

--

- Do we improve our model with `score`?

---

# Why RMSE?

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bsRes <- NULL
for(i in 1:100) {
  inds <- sample(1:nrow(mv),size = round(nrow(mv)/2),replace = F)
  train <- mv %>% slice(inds)
  test <- mv %>% slice(-inds)
  
  mB <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log,train)
  mS <- lm(gross_log ~ score,train)
  mC <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log + score,train)
  
  bsRes <- test %>%

           pC = predict(mC,newdata = test)) %>%
    summarise(Budget = sqrt(mean((gross_log - pB)^2,na.rm=T)),
              Score = sqrt(mean((gross_log - pS)^2,na.rm=T)),
              Combined = sqrt(mean((gross_log - pC)^2,na.rm=T))) %>%
    bind_rows(bsRes)
}
```

---

# Quick Aside: alternative `code`

- `sample_n()` and `anti_join()`

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bsRes <- NULL
for(i in 1:100) {
  train <- mv %>%
    sample_n(size = round(nrow(.)*.8),replace = F)
  test <- mv %>%
    anti_join(train) #<<

  mB <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log,train)
  mS <- lm(gross_log ~ score,train)
  mC <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log + score,train)
  
  bsRes <- test %>%
    mutate(pB = predict(mB,newdata = test),
           pS = predict(mS,newdata = test),
           pC = predict(mC,newdata = test)) %>%
    summarise(Budget = sqrt(mean((gross_log - pB)^2,na.rm=T)),
              Score = sqrt(mean((gross_log - pS)^2,na.rm=T)),
              Combined = sqrt(mean((gross_log - pC)^2,na.rm=T))) %>%
    bind_rows(bsRes) 
}
```

---

# Why RMSE?

```{r}
bsRes %>%
  summarise_all(mean,na.rm=T)
```

---

# Visualizing

```{r}
bsRes %>%
  gather(model,rmse) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rmse,y = reorder(model,rmse))) + 
  geom_violin()
```


---

# Categorical Data

--

- Thus far, only using continuous variables

--

- But we can do regression with categorical data too!

--

- The Bechdel Test: 3 questions of a movie

--

  1. Does it have two women in it?
  2. Who talk to each other?
  3. About something other than a man?
  
```{r}
mv %>%
  count(bechdel_score)
```

---

# Research Question

--

- .blue[Do movies that pass the Bechdel Test make more money?]

--

  - .blue[Theory:] Women are ~50% of the population. Movies that pass the test are more appealing to women.
  
--

  - .blue[Hypothesis:] Movies that pass the test make more money.
  
--

- .red[Wrangling:] Let's turn the `bechdel_score` variable into a binary

```{r}
mv <- mv %>%
  mutate(bechdel_bin = ifelse(bechdel_score == 3,1,0)) %>%
  mutate(bechdel_factor=recode_factor(bechdel_bin,
                                      `1`="Pass",
                                      `0`="Fail",
                                      ))
```

---

# Regression

--

- We can add the binary factor to our regression

```{r}
summary(lm(gross_log ~ bechdel_factor,mv))
```

---

# Regression

- Coefficient is positive

--

- What is the interpretation?

--

  - Movies that fail make more money...
  
--

  - ...than what?
  
--

  - Movies that pass the Bechdel Test
  
--

- Categorical variables are **always interpreted in relation to the hold-out category**!

---

# Regression

- Movies that fail the test make more money!?

--

- **REMEMBER**: Correlation $\neq$ causation

--

  - What might explain this pattern?
  
--

  - Budgets in a sexist Hollywood!
  
--

  - Movies that fail the test get larger budgets
  
--

  - Budgets are positively associated with gross
  
--

- So we want to "control" for budget by adding it to our regression

```{r}
mBechCtrl <- lm(gross_log ~ budget_log + bechdel_factor,mv)
```

---

# Regression

```{r}
summary(mBechCtrl)
```

---

# Regression

- Our hypothesis is supported!

--

- What about non-binary categorical variables?

```{r}
mv %>%
  count(rating)
```

---

# Categorical

- Let's first remove rarely-occurring ratings

```{r}
mvAnalysis <- mv %>%
  filter(!rating %in% c('Approved','TV-14','TV-MA','TV-PG','X'))
```

---

# Categorical

```{r}
summary(lm(gross_log ~ rating,mvAnalysis))
```

---

# Categorical

- Everything makes less money than the hold-out category!

--

  - "G"-rated movies are powered by children
  
--

- What if we wanted to compare to a different reference category?

```{r}
mvAnalysis <- mvAnalysis %>%
  mutate(rating = factor(rating,
                         levels = c('R','PG-13','PG','G','Not Rated')))

mRating2 <- lm(gross_log ~ rating,mvAnalysis)
```

---

# Categorical

```{r}
summary(mRating2)
```

---

# Cross Validation

- This is why `sample_n()` is useful

```{r,warning = F}
set.seed(123)
rmseRes_rating <- NULL
for(i in 1:100) {
  train <- mvAnalysis %>%
    group_by(rating) %>%
    sample_n(size = round(n()*.8),replace = F)
  test <- mvAnalysis %>% anti_join(train)
  
  m <- lm(gross_log ~ rating,train)
  rmseRes_rating <- test %>%
    mutate(preds = predict(m,newdata = test)) %>%
    summarise(rmse = sqrt(mean((gross_log - preds)^2,na.rm=T))) %>%
    bind_rows(rmseRes_rating)
}
rmseRes_rating %>% summarise(rmse = mean(rmse)) #<<
```

# Part II: Logistic Regression 

## Agenda

1. Classification

2. Fortnite gaming (i.e., Prof's desperate attempt to be relevant)

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(tidyverse)
fn <- read_rds('https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC4175_F2024/raw/main/Data/fn_cleaned_final.rds')
```


---

# Definitions

- *Classification:* predicting the **class** of given data points via **predictive modeling**

--

  - *Class*: AKA targets, labels, or **categories**
  
--

  - *Predictive Modeling*: Approximate mapping function $f: X \rightarrow Y$
  
--

  - $X$: predictor variables
  
  - $Y$: outcome variable
  
  - $f$: ??
  
---

# Mapping Functions

- We have already used mapping functions!

--

- Linear Regression

--

  - $f$: $Y = \alpha + \beta X + \varepsilon$
  
--

- Underlying idea: $X$ contain information about $Y$

---

# It is in the $Y$

- If $Y$ is continuous, we use OLS (ordinary least squares) regression

--

- If $Y$ is **binary**, we use "logistic" regression (AKA "logit")

--

  - As always, this is a **deep** area of study for those interested
  
--

- Today, using OLS for binary $Y$

--

  - Next few classes: replacing OLS regression with logit

# Fortnite

- Goal is to win (i.e., be the last player alive)

- Professional e-sports teams want to maximize this probability

- .blue[Research Question]: How can we increase the number of victories?

--

- **NB**: we are moving out of the **.blue[Research]** camp now, and into the **.red[Prediction]** world

--

  - We don't care so much about *why* a relationship exists, we just want to get accurate predictions

--

  - Theory can still help us, but want to start with the data to get our thinking started

---

# The Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
glimpse(fn)
```

---

# The Data

- Start with the basics:

--

  1. What is the unit of analysis?
  
  2. Which variables are we interested in?


---

# Prediction

$$Y = \alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \varepsilon$$

--

- $Y$: victory (`won`)

--

- $X$: ??

--

  - In prediction, we don't care about **theory** or **research questions**

  - Just want to maximize **accuracy**...which $X$'s are the "best"?
  
  - But theory can still help us make sensible choices about which $X$'s to use
  
--

- Look at univariate & conditional relationships

---

# The Data

- Outcome $Y$: `won`

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
require(scales)
fn %>%
  summarise(`Win %` = percent(mean(won)))
```

--

- Multivariate analysis?

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(mental_state) %>%
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won))
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(gameIdSession) %>%
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won))
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(gameIdSession) %>%
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gameIdSession,y = pr_win)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hits,y = won)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# Which $X$?

```{r}
fn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hits,y = won)) + 
  geom_jitter()
```

---

# Heatmaps

- Look at 3-dimensions of data

--

  - Done this before by tweaking `fill`, `color`, or `size`
  
--

- `geom_tile()`: create a heatmap

```{r}
p <- fn %>%
  mutate(accuracy_decile = ntile(hits,n=10)) %>% # Bin hits by decile (10%)
  group_by(accuracy_decile,mental_state) %>% # Calculate average winning by mental state and accuracy
  summarise(pr_win = mean(won),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(mental_state),
             y = factor(accuracy_decile), # Both x and y-axes are factors
             fill = pr_win)) + # Fill by third dimension
  geom_tile() + # Creates rectangles
  scale_fill_gradient(limits = c(0,1)) # Set fill color (can do much more here)
```

---

# Heatmaps

```{r}
p
```

---

# Simplest Predictions

- Remember: regression is just fancier conditional means

```{r}
fn <- fn %>%
  mutate(hits_decile = ntile(hits,n=10)) %>% # Bin hits by decile (10%)
  group_by(hits_decile,mental_state) %>% # Calculate average winning by mental state and accuracy
  mutate(prob_win = mean(won)) %>% # use mutate() instead of summarise() to avoid collapsing the data
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(prob_win > .5,1,0)) %>% # If the probability is greater than 50-50, predict a win
  ungroup()
```

---

# Simplest Predictions

- Conditional means

```{r}
fn %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop')
```

--

- How good is this? Think about the underlying goal...we want a model that accurately predicts whether a game is won or not

- The `won` column is the **truth**...it tells us whether the game was won or not

- The `pred_win` column is our **prediction**

---

# Accuracy

- What is "accuracy"?

--

  - Proportion "correct" predictions
  
--

- For a binary outcome, "accuracy" has two dimensions

--

  - Proportion of correct `1`s: **Sensitivity**
  
  - Proportion of correct `0`s: **Specificity**
  
---

# Accuracy

```{r}
(sumTab <- fn %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = nGames / total_games))
```

--

- Overall accuracy: (`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(nGames))`+`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(nGames))`) / (`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(total_games))`+`r (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(total_games))`) = `r percent(((sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(nGames)) + (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(nGames))) / ((sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(total_games)) + (sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(total_games))))`

- But we are doing **great** at predicting losses (`r percent(sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(prop))`)...

- ...and **terribly** at predicting wins (`r percent(sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(prop))`)

---

# Regression

```{r,message = F}
fn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = damage_to_players,y = won)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

---

# Regression

- Binary outcome variable!

--

  - A linear regression is not the best solution
  
--

  - Predictions can exceed support of $Y$

--

- But it can still work! **linear probability model**

```{r}
mLM <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + mental_state,fn)
```

---

# Linear Regression

```{r}
require(broom) # broom package makes it easy to read regression output
tidy(mLM) %>% # This would be the same as summary(mLM)
  mutate_at(vars(-term),function(x) round(x,5))
```


---

# Evaluating Predictions

```{r}
mLM <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + mental_state + damage_taken + head_shots + gameIdSession,fn)
fn %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mLM)) %>%
  mutate(predBinary = ifelse(preds > .5,1,0)) %>%
  select(won,predBinary,preds)
```

---

# Evaluating Predictions


```{r}
(sumTab <- fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > .5,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = percent(nGames / total_games)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames))))
```

---

# Evaluating Predictions

- Overall accuracy is just the number of correct predictions (either `0` or `1`) out of all possible

--

  - Is `r sumTab$accuracy[1]` good?

--

  - What would the dumbest guess be? Never win! `r percent(1-mean(fn$won))`

--

- Might also want to care about just `1`s

--

  - **Sensitivity**: Predicted wins / actual wins = `r sumTab %>% filter(won == 1 & pred_win == 1) %>% pull(prop)`
  
--

- Also might care about just `0`s

--

  - **Specificity**: Predicted losses / actual losses = `r sumTab %>% filter(won == 0 & pred_win == 0) %>% pull(prop)`
  
---

# Thresholds

- Shifting the threshold for `0` or `1` prediction can matter

--

```{r}
fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > .4,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = percent(nGames / total_games)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames)))
```

---

# Thresholds

- Shifting the threshold for `0` or `1` prediction can matter

```{r}
fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > .7,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = percent(nGames / total_games)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = percent(sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames)))
```

- Restricting to above 70% means we don't think anyone wins!

---

# Thresholds

- We could keep trying different values until we hit on one that maximizes our accuracy

--

- But this is inefficient! Let's loop it instead!

--


```{r}
toplot <- NULL
for(thresh in seq(0,1,by = .025)) {
  toplot <- fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = ifelse(predict(mLM) > thresh,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(won) %>%
  mutate(total_games = n()) %>%
  group_by(won,pred_win,total_games) %>%
  summarise(nGames=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = nGames / total_games) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = sum((won == pred_win)*nGames) / sum(nGames)) %>%
  mutate(threshold = thresh) %>%
    bind_rows(toplot)
}
```

---

# Thresholds

- We might only care about accuracy by itself (although this is a bit naive)

.small[
```{r}
toplot %>%
  select(accuracy,threshold) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = threshold,y = accuracy)) + 
  geom_line()
```
]

---

# Thresholds

.small[
```{r}
toplot %>%
  mutate(metric = ifelse(won == 1 & pred_win == 1,'Sensitivity',
                         ifelse(won == 0 & pred_win == 0,'Specificity',NA))) %>%
  drop_na(metric) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = threshold,y = prop,color = metric)) + 
  geom_line()
```
]

# ROC Curve

- Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve

--

- Commonly used to evaluate classification methods

--

  - X-axis: 1-specificity

  - Y-axis: sensitivity

--

```{r}
p <- toplot %>%
  mutate(metric = ifelse(won == 1 & pred_win == 1,'Sensitivity',
                         ifelse(won == 0 & pred_win == 0,'Specificity',NA))) %>%
  drop_na(metric) %>%
  select(prop,metric,threshold) %>%
  spread(metric,prop) %>%
  arrange(desc(Specificity),Sensitivity) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1-Specificity,y = Sensitivity)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlim(c(0,1)) + ylim(c(0,1)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1,intercept = 0,linetype = 'dotted') + 
  ggridges::theme_ridges()
```

---

# ROC Curve

```{r}
p
```

--

- Better models have high levels of sensitivity **and** specificity at every threshold

---

# AUC Measure

- Area Under the Curve (AUC)

--

  - A single number summarizing classification performance
  
--

```{r,message=F}
require(tidymodels)
roc_auc(data = fn %>%
  mutate(pred_win = predict(mLM),
         truth = factor(won,levels = c('1','0'))) %>%
  select(truth,pred_win),truth,pred_win)
```

---

# AUC

- What is a "good" AUC?

--

  - We know it is bounded between 0 (i.e., it predicts everything **perfectly wrong**) and 1 (i.e., it predicts everything **perfectly correct**)
  
  - But typically we don't see AUC values less than 0.5 (why is this?)
  
--

- AUC can be interpreted like numeric grades at Villanova (and for this class)

  - 0.95+ is amazing
  
  - 0.9 - 0.95 is very good
  
  - 0.8-range is B-tier
  
  - 0.7-range is C-tier
  
  - 0.6-range is really bad
  
  - AUC values less than 0.6 are failing

# Party time!

- Adding more variables / trying different combinations

- **Workflow**

--

  1. Train models
  
  2. Predict models
  
  3. Evaluate models

# Train models

```{r}

m5 <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + head_shots + mental_state + distance_traveled,fn)
m6 <- lm(won ~ hits + accuracy + mental_state + head_shots + distance_traveled + gameIdSession,fn)

# Predict models

```{r}

         m6Preds = predict(m6),
         truth = factor(won,levels = c('1','0')))

# Evaluate models

```{r}

for(model in 1:6) {
  rocRes <- roc_auc(toEval,truth,paste0('m',model,'Preds')) %>%
    mutate(model = paste0('Model ',model)) %>%
    bind_rows(rocRes)
}
```

# Evaluate models

```{r}

  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  ggridges::theme_ridges() + labs(x = 'AUC',y = 'Regression Model')

# Conclusion

- Classification is just a type of prediction

--

  - We used linear regression
  
--

  - But there are **much** fancier algorithms out there
